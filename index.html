    <p>Steven Universe is a human-gem hybrid who goes on magical adventures
       with the rest of the Crystal Gems, Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl. Steven
       encounters with many other gems on their missions.He explores the 
       abilities passed down to him by his mother, which include fusion, the 
       ability of Gems to merge their bodies and abilities to form new and 
       more powerful personalities. They fight gem monsters and protect the 
       Earth from Homeworld. Homeworld is where the original gems are from 
       and is ruled by the Diamonds. Their plan is to hollow out the Earth 
       to form a new gem colony. This would cause all life on Earth to end.Peridot 
       is forced to ally with the Crystal Gems to prevent Earth's destruction by a 
       Gem abomination growing in the planet's core. In the third season, Peridot 
       and Lapis Lazuli, an errant Homeworld Gem, join the Crystal Gems. Jasper is 
       at length defeated, and Steven learns that his mother killed one of Gem 
       society's four matriarchs, Pink Diamond.</p>
